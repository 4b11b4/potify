1. Command to run the postgres server (Linux):
/usr/lib/postgresql/10/bin/pg_ctl -D /var/lib/postgresql/10/main -l start logfile

2. Notes from installing Vue.js:
- installed yarn and nose.js.. where do we track this dependency? it is obviously not tracked by pip
- in potify/potify/frontend, a folder called node_modules was installed after running yarn... i assume this is not what we want

3. Vue is able to access urls set up by Django 
if you navigate to
localhost:8080 loads index.html from frontend/public which then loads frontend/src/App.vue and whatever is in the <div id="app"> which then has a function which does an HTTP GET '/api/phrases/'
whereas
localhost:8000 loads from our django base html template?
* How do we tell Django that we want to load the index.html in frontend/public/?

4. Static file management
* I assume we do not want to commit frontend/dist/ to the repo
