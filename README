#virtualenvwrapper
https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
1. pip3 install --user wheel
2. pip3 install --user virtualenv
3. pip3 install --user virtualenvwrapper
4. When installing as user, pip may put virtualenv at
   ~/.local/bin/virtualenv
   In this case, you need to copy the binary to /usr/bin because
   the wrapper is looking for it there. Adding the path to PATH does not
   work, because wrapper looks for virtualenv in /usr/bin.
   e.g.
   cp -r ~/.local/bin/virtualenv /usr/bin/virtualenv
5. mkvirtualenv potify
6. When returning to the directory to work, run:
   workon potify

#pip
1. First time installation of packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   (note) pip will likely throw you an error about "pkg-resources=0.0.0".
   This is apparently caused by Ubuntu providing some bad metadata to pip
     when you are in a virtualenv.
   https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/4022
   At the above issue, looks to be solved in some version of pip.
   It may break the virtualenv if removed.
   I moved it to the last line of the requirements.txt so everything else
     continues to be installed. This will likely be overwritten if reqs
     are frozen again.
   We can simply ignore the error from the pip install then?
2. pip install -r requirements.txt does not work when it reaches this error.
3. Remove the pkg-resources=0.0.0 line from requirements.txt so that pip
   can proceed to actually install everything.
4. At this point you should be able to run:
   ./manage.py runserver

#yarn
https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable
1. curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
2. echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
3. sudo apt update && sudo apt install yarn

#yarn install
0. Before running yarn install, you may need a later version of nodejs.
1. For Debian systems, see:
   https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md#deb
2. curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
3. sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
4. Now, you can run:
   yarn install
