1. Command to run the postgres server (Linux):
/usr/lib/postgresql/10/bin/pg_ctl -D /var/lib/postgresql/10/main -l start logfile

2. yarn and nodejs dependencies
* Installed yarn and nodejs via apt
  * Where do we track this dependency? (it is obviously not tracked by pip)

3. node_modules
* In /potify/frontend/, a folder called node_modules was created after running yarn
  * This folder should be added to the .gitignore?

3. Vue is able to access urls set up by Django 
Navigate to:
- localhost:8080 loads index.html from frontend/public which then loads frontend/src/App.vue and whatever is in the <div id="app"> which then has a function which does an HTTP GET '/api/phrases/'
whereas
- localhost:8000 loads from our django base html template?
* How do we tell Django that we want to load the index.html in frontend/public/?
* Noob Question: are we still going to use Django's views? Or will be creating <div>s within App.vue?

4. Static file management
* I assume we do not want to commit frontend/dist/ to the repo
