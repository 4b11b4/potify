Command to run the postgres server (Linux):
/usr/lib/postgresql/10/bin/pg_ctl -D /var/lib/postgresql/10/main -l start logfile

Notes from installing Vue.js:
- installed yarn and nose.js.. where do we track this dependency? it is obviously not tracked by pip
- in potify/potify/frontend, a folder called node_modules was installed after running yarn... i assume this is not what we want
